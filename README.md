## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** EJS, Tailwind, JavaScript, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose


## Optimizations
Automatic Pharmacy Discovery

Instead of relying solely on user input to populate the list of nearby pharmacies, have DWMA leverage publicly available data sources, such as pharmacy directories or APIs, to automatically fetch and add pharmacies to the search results. By integrating with these data sources, the app can regularly update its database with the latest pharmacy information, including their locations and contact details.

## Disclaimer
DWMA is an informational tool and should not be used as a substitute for professional medical advice. Always consult a healthcare professional or pharmacist before making decisions related to medication use.
